career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My passion is to make advances in healthcare using data science and machine learning.
      I am the lead of a group of 5 machine learning associates in NIBR, NX as well as one of the leads of the "AI and Tools" work-package
      of the IMI - BigPicture consortium, aimed at advancing the state of AI in histopathology.

      In my career I have worked on a wide range of data science problems in the healthcare field.
      This experience spans from working on clinical study protocols, the development of predictive
      algorithms for kidney disease to the statistical analysis of experiments
      in early non-clinical research with microarray, NGS and other biomarker data.
